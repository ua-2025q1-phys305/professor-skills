# PHYS305 Project #2

Welcome to the repository for **Project #2** in PHYS305.
This project is worth **20 points**, two times of a homework.
Hence, your team is expected to spend roughly two times more work on
this project compared to homeworks.
It is designed to let you apply numerical techniques that we covered
in the classes.
You must form teams of 3 to 6 people.
Presentations will be scheduled for April 29th or May 1st, and the
final code and documentation are due exactly **one week after your
presentation**, by 11:59pm (Arizona time).
Projects that are presented on April 29th will receive two points
extra credits.
Code submission is handled by GitHub classroom.
Please use [this link](https://classroom.github.com/a/KMYdNApn) to
join a project.

You are encuraged to form different teams than project 1.
Project ideas should come from numerical methods we learn in second
half of the class, namely, numerical integration of ODEs or PDEs, or
Monte Carlo simulations.
Examples of previous projects inlcude
[Barnes-Hut simulation](https://github.com/uarizona-2022spring-phys105a/AG-Project-2),
[3-body problem](https://github.com/uarizona-2022spring-phys105a/adelawad-Three-Body-Problem-Project-2), and
[exoplanet statistics](https://github.com/ua-2024q3-astr513/ASTRSTATS513_final).

A formal written report is not required, but you must:

1. Submit well-documented source codes with clear comments through
   GitHub classroom.
   Provide docstrings and update this README to explain how to run
   your project and discusses any dependencies.

2. Deliver a short (about 10 minutes) presentation on April 29th or
   May 1st, using either slides (standard presentation) or a Jupyter
   notebook (like our class), to describe the problem you tackled and
   how you solved it.
   Show your numerical methods, data or results, and any plots or
   tables that shed light on your findings.
   Each team member should be ready to discuss their contributions.

Your project will be graded out of 20 points with the following
general breakdown:

1. Problem Definition (4 pts): How clearly you define and motivate
   your chosen problem (e.g., describing the physics, data, or goals)

2. Code Quality & Documentation (4 pts): Correctness, clarity, ease of
   use, and thorough commenting and README

3. Numerical Methods & Implementation (4 pts): Demonstrating you
   understand the techniques you are applying and why they are
   appropriate

4. Results & Presentation Materials (4 pts): Clarity of figures,
   tables, or numerical outputs, and how convincingly you interpret
   them

5. Oral Presentation Delivery (4 pts): How effectively your group
   communicates your methods, addresses questions, and demonstrates
   teamwork

Project is handled by GitHub classroom as well, where multiple
students can create a single repository to track codes.
Only one submission (code + documentation) per team is needed.
Be sure to list all group members.
Late submissions may not be accepted, so plan ahead and start
early.
We look forward to seeing your creativity and thoroughness as you
tackle a meaningful computational physics problem!
